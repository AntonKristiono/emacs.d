# Azzamsa's Emacs config

this is my emacs config.

## Thanks toâ€¦

- Heavily inspired by [Bozhidar Batsov](http://batsov.com) and his [emacs.d repository](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d)
- [John Wiegley](https://github.com/jwiegley) - [.emacs](https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs) repository.
- Kaushal Modi - [.emacs](https://github.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d)
- I also look to various .emacs repositories to take any insight, so the credits also go for them.
