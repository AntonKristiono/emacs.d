# Azzamsa's Emacs config

This is my emacs configuration.

If you're looking for a nice (copy and use) scripts, check out my [useful Emacs
Lisp scripts collection](https://azzamsa.com/blog/scripts-el/)

## Inspired by:

The big parts comes from:

- [Bozhidar Batsov](http://batsov.com) - [emacs.d repository](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d) and [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
- [Oleh Krehel](https://oremacs.com/) - [oremacs](https://github.com/abo-abo/oremacs)

Other small parts comes from:

[Steve Purcell](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d), [John Wiegley](https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs),
[Dr Ben Maughan](http://pragmaticemacs.com/), [Xah Lee](http://ergoemacs.org),
[Terencio (rememberYou) Agozzino](https://github.com/rememberYou/.emacs.d),
and [John Kitchin](http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/about.html).

I also look to various .emacs repositories to take any insight, so the credits also go for them.

## Thanks to:
